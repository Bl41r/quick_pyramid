# quick_pyramid
Quick Pyramid is a tool in development for creating web applications in 
Pyramid even faster than it already is.  This project is in its infancy, 
and features are still being decided.  This code is currently being developed
for Linux based machines.

I'm basically piecing together old projects in order to create a pyramid 
automation tool.

### Planned Features (in order of current priority)
- Automatic route creation
- Built-in templates
- Generic built in forms for login/registration
- Security - Authentication/Authorization, Permissions, CSRF...
- Testing (unit and functional, including setting up db_session, etc..)
- Database selection with sqlalchemy (sqlite or Postgres...)
- Creation of models


## How to use (This section will be added to as project advances)

### Clone this repo
```
some steps go here, cd into project src...
```

### Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv ENV
source ENV/bin/activate
```

### Configure a bunch of stuff
```
etc...
```
